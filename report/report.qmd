# Reflection

* What was the easiest part of this assignment?
    Wireframing the design
* What is the hardest part of this assignment?
    Coming up with a navigation system for the design
* Comment on how your storyboard and wireframing experience in the dynamic calling card prepared your for this assignment.
    It made it easier to prepare my navigation system
* What could we have covered in class to better prepare you for this assignment?
    Im not sure, it was all based on some outside influence.
